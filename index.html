<p>
Hi, I'm Shenglan. I am a master student conducting my M2 internship of Human-Computer Interaction at the <a href="https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/">EMC</a> (Université Lumière Lyon 2), under the supervision of Jordan Navarro. 
<p>
My current research focuses on how a driver’s perceived agency influences their neural activation patterns, comparing manual driving and diffrent levels of automated driving scenarios. This work aims to inform the design of more intuitive and safer human-centered autonomous systems.
<p>
I am actively seeking a CIFRE thesis for the next 3 years (2026–2029). My goal is to continue exploring these fascinating human-machine interactions in a practical industrial context.
