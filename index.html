<p>
Hi, I'm Shenglan. I am a master student conducting my M2 internship of Human-Computer Interaction at the <a href="https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/">EMC</a> (Université Lumière Lyon 2), under the supervision of Jordan Navarro. My research focuses on how a driver’s perceived agency influences their brain activation patterns.
<p>
I am deeply fascinated by the interaction between humans and advanced technology. I believe this research is essential in our current era, as technology evolves and reshapes our daily interactions.
<p>
Driven by a curiosity about how research can be applied in the industry, I am actively seeking a CIFRE thesis for the next 3 years (2026–2029). My goal is to continue exploring these fascinating human-machine interactions in a practical, industrial context.
