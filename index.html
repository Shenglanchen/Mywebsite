<p>
I am a master student working on Human-Computer Interaction at the <a href="https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/">EMC</a> (Université Lumière Lyon 2).
<p>
My research goal is to investigate how AI-driven technologies, ranging from smart mobility solutions to complex automated industrial interfaces, affect human cognitive states, such as the sense of agency and trust. I aim to contribute to the development of next-generation Human-Centered tool, ensuring that highly advanced machines remain intuitive and safe for the user.
<p>
I am currently seeking a CIFRE PhD position (2026–2029) at the intersection of Cognitive Sciences and the Industry.
